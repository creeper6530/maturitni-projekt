- Set the display brightness with a potentiometer
  - Would be polled, datasheet shows no trace of interrupts on value change (duh, there's noise on the ADC input after all)
  - And if we felt super fancy, we could even use a phototransistor as well to implement a turnoffable adaptive brightness
  - Or could instead simply set the brightness with a command via UART...
- Figure out a way to do UART receiving asynchronously – without polling, but interrupts, DMA or similar funsies. Just so that we don't block and can go to WFI/WFE sleep.
  - I already tried something and failed miserable. That's why we poll ATM.
  - Maybe I should've gone with async Embassy instead...
- Make a common file for all constants instead of them being spread around `stack.rs`, `textbox.rs` and `main.rs`, or at least add runtime checks that matching consts equal.
- Add some functionality to the ANSI escape codes
  - Arrow keys could move the cursor in the textbox – left-right keys; and scroll through either the last inputs (would need history keeping) or through values in stack (would need peeking at arbitrary depth) like in a terminal – up-down keys.
  - Delete key could either operate on the textbox, alias Backspace or drop the topmost item from the stack (alias Shift-D)
  - Maybe use PgUp and PgDn keys to scroll through the stack's preview?
  - F-keys are ANSI escaped and could be used for more advanced functions instead of letter keys
  - See [ANSI escape code#Terminal input sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code?useskin=vector#Terminal_input_sequences) for more details
- Consider adding attributes to the `memory.x` linker script, as described [here](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/doc/gnu/ld_3.html#SEC37).
