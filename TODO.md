- Get better error handling, no unwrap()-s, or at the very least expect()-s. Panics are for irrecoverable catastrophes.
  - Get a better way to show error than polluting the textbox. Leading idea: show a black `E` in a white square in the top right corner, or for grave errors clear screen white and show a big `ERROR` text before resetting with `cortex_m::peripheral::SCB::sys_reset()` (after a delay, of course).
  - Especially handle overflows when doing number shit. Currently we have overflow checks in both `debug` and `release` targets, but that's again a panic...
    - The `a.checked_add(b)` function(s) may help
- Switch to `rtt-target` in order to be able to finer control RTT, instead of `defmt-rtt`.
  - Perhaps we could use its probe-to-target comms in place of UART to rid ourselves of one wire? But then we'd require a probe attached, not a generic UART. We probably won't always need a probe...
  - Docs on how to do it [here](https://docs.rs/rtt-target/latest/rtt_target/#defmt-integration).
- Set the display brightness with a potentiometer
  - Would be polled, datasheet shows no trace of interrupts on value change (duh)
- Figure out a way to do UART receiving asynchronously â€“ without polling, but interrupts, DMA or similar funsies. Just so that we don't block and can go to WFI/WFE sleep.
  - I already tried something and failed miserable. That's why we poll ATM.
- Make a common file for all constants instead of them being spread around `stack.rs`, `textbox.rs` and `main.rs`, or at least add runtime checks that matching consts equal.
- Allow a const to configure the default precision of `DecimalFixed`
- Add some functionality to the ANSI escape codes
  - Arrow keys could move the cursor in the textbox
  - Delete key could either operate on the textbox, alias Backspace or drop the topmost item from the stack (alias Shift-D)
  - Maybe use PgUp and PgDn keys to scroll through the stack's preview?
  - F-keys are ANSI escaped and could be used for more advanced functions instead of letter keys
  - See [ANSI escape code#Terminal input sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code?useskin=vector#Terminal_input_sequences) for more details
- Move the pushing of textbox to stack to a separate function instead of duplicating it in CR/LF case and operands case
